# ML
In this project I used different machine learning algorithms, analyzed data and compared their performance.
I prepared the data and implemented a decision tree, a neural network, and and K-Means algorithm. I used Python programming language and popular libraries such as skit-learn, numpy and pandas to implement the models.
